Clioâ€™s newly revamped front-end, codenamed Apollo, is a sophisticated single-page application compiled using Webpack, a popular module bundler used by many large-scale applications.

The contribution of Webpack cannot be overstated: feature-rich and well-supported, it has greatly accelerated the development of Apollo and enabled Clio to deliver a great experience to its customers.

However, it is a truism that with great power comes great responsibility. And Webpack, with its dizzying array of extensions and optional features, is most certainly a tool whose usage requires special care and attention. Without informed stewardship and regular maintenance, a Webpack project can often fall prey to chaos.

This instructive manual begins with an exposition that outlines the problem Clio's developers faced when the expansion of Apollo started to expose scalability issues long dormant in Apollo's Webpack set-up. It proceeds to describe the maintenance performed in order to combat this issue, detailing the basic workflow involved in upgrading Webpack and highlighting particular issues that appeared along the way. The manual concludes by describing the impact of the upgrade on Apollo.

This manual (with small amendments) is published on Medium (https://labs.clio.com/wrangling-with-webpack-pt-1-an-emergency-driven-upgrade-439eccb4a21b) as the first installment of a two-part series focusing on Webpack performance. There, the manual becomes more than just a practical guide on maintaining a Webpack project, it also serves as an additional piece in Clio's overarching strategy to establish a greater presence for itself within the technological community.

With its primary audience being developers outside of Clio, this manual has been purposefully framed within the context of a narrative and avoids discussing nuanced details as much as possible. Its focus on being easily consumable by a wide range of readers has meant that certain details were left out for the sake of clarity.

As such, it is perhaps unsurprising that this manual lacks many characteristics typical of other corporate user manuals. For example, explicit steps are almost non-existent and the text resembles nothing so much as a collection of tips and suggestions arranged in no particular order. But this is by design. As noted earlier, this manual is intended to be short and interesting. If the structure of the manual were more traditional, it would not fulfill this purpose.

That aside, a number of fair criticisms can certainly be leveled against it. The lack of diagrams and other visual elements, for example, make it less effective at delivering its content to the reader.

All in all, the manual's short length and plain language belies the technicality of the subject it addresses, and it may fall short of the purposes it was intended for. Nevertheless, it is an accessible piece of literature that provides a window into Clio's software systems, and hopes to be useful to other developers sharing the same art.
